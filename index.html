		<h2>What we do</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/" title="The global Awesome Foundation">The Awesome Foundation</a> is an international philanthropic organization devoted to forwarding the interest of awesomeness in the universe. Every month we award a no-strings-attached grant of $1,000 to a project that we deem Awesome. We&apos;re interested in a wide variety of projects, ranging from <a href="http://from.postcardsfromfarraway.org/" title="Postcards From Farr Away">friendly postcards sent to random strangers</a> to <a href="http://www.onnof.us/" title="Onn/Of light festival">light festivals</a> to <a href="http://popupmuseum.blogspot.com/p/testing.html" title="The Pop-Up Museum">pop-up museums</a> (and all sorts of other things; check out <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/seattle" title="Awesome Seattle projects">all of the projects we&apos;ve funded</a>). If you think your idea is worth $1,000, send us an application!</p>

		<h2>What we look for</h2>

		<p>There are no set rules about what we will or won&apos;t fund, but here are some of the things we think about:</p>

		<div class="inset">
			<h3>We like things that are <em>possible</em>.</h3>
			<p>We&apos;re all for crazy ideas, but we also want to know that you can achieve what you&apos;re setting out to do. If a project fails, we want it to be due to the inherent risks of the idea, not the implementation.</p>
			
			<h3>We like projects that are <em>not incremental</em>.</h3>
			<p>Keeping a good thing going is great, but it&apos;s not what we&apos;re here for. We want our grants to help new ideas take off!</p>
	
			<h3>We like <em>local</em> projects.</h3>
			<p>We&apos;re invested in our local community and we want to do things that help Seattle grow. If your project isn&apos;t based in Washington state, consider applying to one of the <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters" title="Awesome Foundation chapters around the world">more than 70 Awesome Foundation chapters</a> around the world.</p>
	
			<h3>We like projects that are <em>visible</em> and have clear <em>community benefit</em>.</h3>
			<p>Continuing with our focus on community, we also lean towards projects that bring people together. We like to see people coming together through a project instead of enjoying it in isolation.</p>
	
			<h3>We like projects that are run by <em>people</em>.</h3>
			<p>There are a lot of funding channels for established organizations, and we&apos;re all for that. However, we prefer to use this money to support individuals and small groups.</p>
	
			<h3>We like projects that are <em>Awesome</em>.</h3>
			<p>Like we said before, these aren&apos;t <em>rules</em>, they&apos;re guidelines. We are more than happy to throw away everything we mentioned earlier for any project that makes us stop in our tracks and say &ldquo;Whoah! That&apos;s <strong>awesome</strong>!&rdquo;</p>
		</div>

		<p>If you&apos;d like more feedback on a grant proposal, we normally hold office hours (we call it &ldquo;Awesome Hours&rdquo;) on the third Thursday of the month. Join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/AFSEA-announce">announcements list</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/awesomeseattle">follow us on Twitter</a> to get timely announcements about Awesome Hours and other events. And, as always, <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/submissions/new?chapter=seattle" title="Apply for grant!">send us an application</a> if you think your idea is a good fit!</p>
	</div>

	<div id="trustees">
		<h2>Join us</h2>

		<p>Awesome Seattle is made up of individuals who contribute their time and money to support awesomeness in Seattle. Each month 10 trustees get together, read proposals, and contribute $100 to the cause (adding up to the $1,000 that we give out as a grant). In addition to our full-time trustees, who participate every single month, we have a small number of guest trustee spots for anyone who is curious about what we do or unsure about committing to giving every month.</p>

		<p>If you&apos;d like to join us, send an email to <a href="mailto:seattle@awesomefoundation.org">seattle@awesomefoundation.org</a> and introduce yourself. We promise not to bite!</p>
